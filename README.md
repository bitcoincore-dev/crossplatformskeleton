[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bitcoincore-dev/crossplatformskeleton.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/bitcoincore-dev/crossplatformskeleton)

The trend seems to use frameworks that build on top of an built in webbrowser leading to wasting tons of RAM.

This little project skeleton may help to create a simple QT based cross platform application.

Features
--------
